# Bengali Numeric (BN) Calculator

<img align="right" src="assets/images/playstore.png" height="190"></img>

<p align="justify" >
Bengali Numeric Calculator, in short, BN Calculator is designed with a custom <a href="lib/src/widget/button_widget.dart">neumorphic button</a> class, with a custom button press sound, that imitates the sound of a physical calculator. In addition to that, it has a beautiful dark theme, and a user can turn On/Off the dark theme using a custom animated button on the AppBar. I will be releasing this application on the Google Play store on 21st February to celebrate International Mother Language Day. If I get enough positive responses from the users, then I will release it on Apple AppStore.
